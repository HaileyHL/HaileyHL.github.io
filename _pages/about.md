**Here is my [CV](/assets/pdf/Hailey_Li_CV.pdf) as of January 2026.**

My name is Haolin (Hailey) Li. I am a master's student in CS at the [University of California San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/). My research interest lies broadly in CS education. Specifically, I am commited to exploring better teaching practices and bringing accessibility to the introduction to programming and computer science.

I do both research and teaching. My thesis project advised by Prof. [Michael Coblenz](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mcoblenz/) is on understanding how professional developers debug and how to teach debugging more effectively. I am also a research assistant with Prof. [Leo Porter](https://leoporter.ucsd.edu/) in the [CER Lab](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/cs-ed-research-group/home), where I study how students engage in [vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) processes. Alongside research, I have consistently served as a teaching assistant at UCSD and was the [MITES Semester](https://mites.mit.edu/discover-mites/mites-semester/) 2025 CS instructor.

Before UCSD, I graduated Magna Cum Laude from [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/), double majoring in CS and Sociology. While at Wellesley, I worked as a research assistant at the [MIT STEP lab](https://education.mit.edu/) in the [Everyday AI research project](https://education.mit.edu/project/everyday-ai-for-youth-edai/). Before Wellesley, I was at [UWC Atlantic](https://www.uwcatlantic.org/) in Wales, the UK. This educational movement introduced me to the fields of education and sociology.

Outside of academics, I enjoy video games and music. With 12 years of choir experience, I now sing as an alto in the [La Jolla Symphony and Chorus](https://www.lajollasymphony.com/).
