## Local setup using Docker

Using Docker to install Jekyll and Ruby dependencies is the easiest way.

You need to take the following steps to get `al-folio` up and running on your local machine:

- First, install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- Finally, run the following command that will pull the latest pre-built image from DockerHub and will run your website.

```bash
$ docker compose pull
$ docker compose up
```

## Running Prettier

- If not already, install npm.

```bash
$ npm install
```

- Run npm format

```bash
$ npm run format
```

## License

The website is adopted from [**al-folio**](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/main/LICENSE).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license). Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
