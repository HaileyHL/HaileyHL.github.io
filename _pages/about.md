**Here is my [CV](/assets/pdf/Hailey_Li_CV.pdf) as of January 2025.**

My name is Haolin (Hailey) Li. I am a master's student in CS at the [University of California San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/). My research interest lies broadly in CS education. Specifically, I am commited to exploring better teaching practices and bringing accessibility to the introduction to programming and computer science. I do both research and teaching.

Before UCSD, I graduated Magna Cum Laude from [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/), double majoring in CS and Sociology. While at Wellesley, I worked as a research assistant at the [MIT STEP lab](https://education.mit.edu/) in the [Everyday AI research project](https://education.mit.edu/project/everyday-ai-for-youth-edai/). Before Wellesley, I was at [UWC Atlantic](https://www.uwcatlantic.org/) in Wales, the UK. This educational movement introduced me to the fields of education and sociology.

Outside of academics, I enjoy video games and music. With 12 years of choir experience, I now sing as an alto in the [La Jolla Symphony and Chorus](https://www.lajollasymphony.com/).
