**Here is my [CV](/assets/pdf/Hailey_Li_CV.pdf) as of January 2025.**

My name is Haolin (Hailey) Li. I am a master's student in CS at the [University of California San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/). My research interest lies broadly in PL/SE and HCI education. Specifically, I am commited to exploring culturally inclusive and active pedagogy at the upper-secondary and undergraduate levels. I am also interested in AI-integrated teaching strategies.

Before UCSD, I graduated Magna Cum Laude from [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/), double majoring in CS and Sociology. While at Wellesley, I worked as a research assistant at the [MIT STEP lab](https://education.mit.edu/) in the [Everyday AI research project](https://education.mit.edu/project/everyday-ai-for-youth-edai/). Before Wellesley, I was at [UWC Atlantic](https://www.uwcatlantic.org/) in Wales, the UK. This educational movement introduced me to the fields of education and sociology.

I enjoy video games and made a [two-player children's game](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs365/demos/Sp24/SplashAndSprout/) at the Wellesley playable media lab. I also love all genres of music. With 12 years of choir experience, I now sing as an alto in the [La Jolla Symphony and Chorus](https://www.lajollasymphony.com/).
